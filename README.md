# 🏆 Daily Coding Challenges
This repository is just where I collect my daily coding challenge solutions.

🤔 Why?
I do daily challenges for a few reasons:

I love a good puzzle
Daily practice = Repetition of core concepts
Love to smash the friendly competition
What better way to deepen my understanding of the language than to use it?
📓 Some Notes
At the moment all the challenges here are Codewars katas. I keep note of their names, but not the instructions. If you want to work on a the same kata as I have, please feel free to visit my profile and view my completed list.

I love friendly competition, so if you want to crush me on the leaderboard, feel free to follow me on there and let me know so I can follow you back.

These challenges are a study tool for me, so you'll likely see a lot of repetition of the same challenge. I do this so that I can practice with different methods, or sometimes just for kicks.
